# Question & Answer

This project provides event organizers the ability to run multiple question and answer sessions at their event.

Their are 4 JSON Objects being used on this project: Moderators, Sessions, Questions and Votes.

* Moderators are autocreated on the first action within the admin portal. It is stored as :
{"approve":{"approve":true}}

Only one moderator object will exist at a given time and the bool can be updated accordingly. It acts universally for all sessions within that event.

* Sessions are created within the admin portal and activate the user functionality on the mobile side. They are stored as: 
{"-L0LcTeJ3AiahF2eiLZm":{"sessionName":"Test"}

These are sorted via a unique key and the data containes a session. Each session should be uniquely named.

* Questions are created via the mobile app to track each question, the time it was created, the associated session, total votes and the user it was created by. They are stored via a unique key and a data object similar to: 
{"-L0Pq9I2_1mJXlZwcmbt":{"anom":false,"answered":true,"approve":true,"block":false,"creator":{"company":"Les Mis√©rables","email":"jean@valjean.com","firstName":"Jean","id":"24601","identifier":"jvj24601","image":"https://images.amcnetworks.com/bbcamerica.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/55/files/2012/12/Hugh-Jackman-Les-Miserables.jpg","lastName":"Valjean","title":"Character","username":"jean@valjean.com"},"dateCreate":1513352635626,"event":{"appId":"sample-bundle-id","description":"Happy New Year","endDate":"2017-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","id":"sample-event-id","name":"New Year Kickoff","startDate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"},"lastEdit":1513353401000,"new":false,"pin":false,"score":0,"session":"Session 1","text":"New Question"}

The Question object tracks much of the important data points that can be updated/filtered via the app/admin portal.

* Votes are the last relevant object. They are stored via the same key as their associated question. Within the JSON object each vote can be tracked simply by a numeral and the associated userID:
{"-L0Pq9I2_1mJXlZwcmbt":{"24601":1}

This allows us to attach it to the associated question and track votes by any given user.
